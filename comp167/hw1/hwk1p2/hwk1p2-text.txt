To solve this problem, I used nearly identical code as part 1. The only change I
made was in the main function, in which I changed the arguments of the label
call to match the folds for the cross validation problem.

The 1NN method accurately labeled 23/30 cases (77%).
The 3NN method accurately labeled 18/30 cases (60%).
