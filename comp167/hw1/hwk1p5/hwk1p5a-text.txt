1.	One way to select a subset of the genes for corollation with smoking
status is to find the genes with the greatest distance between known
current smokers and known never smokers.

2.	Another way to select a subset would be to randomly select genes, and
then perform cross validation using only the distances from the selected genes.
If the gene improves the average correctly labeled through cross validation,
it may be more strongly correlated with smoking status than a gene that lowers
the average.
