I selected EMR2, CLCN1, and CCND2 to be my correlated genes. I found them
by scripting to find genes that, on average, had multiplicatively lower
or higher expression from current smokers to never smokers, and selecting a few
that were returned.

When I reran part 2 with the modified data set the percentage improved slightly.
The 1NN method labeled 25/30 correctly (83%), up from (77%).
The 3NN method labeled 19/30 correctly (63%), up from (60%).

Although the improvement is not drastic, it shows that selecting specific genes
to test can improve the accuracy of the labeling, and perhaps a larger selection
of correlated genes could further improve the accuracy.
