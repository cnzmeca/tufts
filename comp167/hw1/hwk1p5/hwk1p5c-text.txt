EMR2 - EMR2 is involved in mucus production and secretion, which would
understandably be hindered by frequent smoking, as represented in the data.

CLCN1 - Interestingly, CLCN1 is involved in the active transport that allows
muscle contraction and relaxation to take place. My only guess as to how this
could be affected by smoking is that smoking puts strain on muscles, meaning
they require more active transport of ions to maintain the same function.

CCND2 - CCND2 is involved in the regulatation of cell cycle during mitosis, and
also phosphorylizes a tumor supressor protein Rb, making it potentially
involved in cancer pathways.
