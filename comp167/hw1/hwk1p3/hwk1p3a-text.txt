To solve this problem, I again used nearly identical code as parts 1 and 2.
I changed literals necessary to match the ALL vs AML problem and altered
the math to calculate the folds to 4 groups of 10 and a group of 8.

The 1NN method accurately labeled 46/48 cases (96%).
The 3NN method accurately labeled 45/48 cases (94%).
