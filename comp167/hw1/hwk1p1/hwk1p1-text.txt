To solve this problem, I read in the data from the given text files and parsed
them into two matrices. For each column in the test matrix, I calculated the
distance between that column and every column in the train matrix. I sorted
the distances and found which was closest(1NN) and out of the 3 closest, which
won the majority vote(3NN).
