To solve the hierarchical problem I used the same method as in part 3b, but
I appended the two data sets together before clustering.

To solve the kmeans problem, I again used the same method as in part 3c, but
appended the data sets before clustering.

I found it more difficult to assign labels to the combined data set using
clustering than the separate sets using nearest neighbours. The clustering
algorithms didn't seem to want to produce 2 substantial clusters, so I had
to fiddle with distances and methods in order to get results, which I
attribute to the rather broad range of current smokers.
