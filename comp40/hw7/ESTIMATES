HW3 Estimates

90-degree rotation
        row-major - 4
        column-major - 4
        block-major - 1

180-degree rotation
        row-major - 1
        column-major - 6
        block-major - 1

There are two things to consider when estimating the hit rate of a rotation
using a given mapping order: the locality of the data before the rotation, and
the locality of the data after the rotation. Block major for both rotations and
row major for a 180 degree rotation all have their data stored contiguously in
memory before and after the rotation, meaning they will have the highest hit
rate. Row major for a 90 degree rotation will have its data stored contiguously
in memory before the rotation, but not after. Conversely, column major for a 90
degree rotation will have its data stored noncontiguously in memory before the
rotation, but contiguously after. Therefore, they will have similar and lower
hit rates than the aforementioned operations. Finally, column major for a 180
degree rotation will have its data stored noncontiguously before and after the
rotation, meaning it will have the lowest hit rate of all the operations
