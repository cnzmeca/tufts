This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1:

  Job: Processes command lines to get file name.

  Candidate names: getfName commLineArgs findFileName

  Best name: getfName

  Why the given name is the best: Short and specific





Function #2:

  Job: Open a file with given file name.

  Candidate names: openf openFileWithName getFileVariable

  Best name: openf

  Why the given name is the best: Short and specific





Function #3:

  Job: Calulate the average brightness.

  Candidate names: calcAvg getMean findAverage

  Best name: calcAvg

  Why the given name is the best: Short and specific
