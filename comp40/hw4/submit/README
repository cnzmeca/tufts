Assignment 4: Arith

Collaboration:
I discussed the assignment with fellow classmates and received advice from TAs.

Implementation:
Everything has been implemented correctly.

Architecture:
The compression is broken up into 3 phases, each of which has its own module:
ppm_ypp, ypp_ppabcd, and ppabcd_codeword. Each module handles the conversion
between the two formats in the module's name. The functions from these modules
are called via the mapping functions in compress40 which compress or decompress 
each 2x2 block completely before operating on the next block. 40image contains
the main function which handles command line arguments to decide whether to
compress or decompress and where the image will come from. Bitpack contains
functions to assist in the bit manipulation necessary for handling codewords.

Time Spent:
Analysis: 10 hours
Problem Solving: 25 hours
