I received help from TAs and discussed the assignment with classmates.

Everything has been implemented correctly except for division with negative
operands.

There have been no departures from the recommended calling convention

I chose to implement the print module by building a data structure and iterating
through it.

I spent 5 hours anaylyzing the assignment, 15 hours writing assembly code and
10 hours debugging.
