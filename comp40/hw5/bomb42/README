We discussed the assignment with classmates and received help from TAs.

Phase 1: Explodes unless the given string is equivalent to the string: 
	 "You may charm it with smiles and soap."
Phase 2: Explodes unless the given string contains 6 integers, starting at 1,
	 and incrementing by 5.
Phase 3: Explodes unless the given string contains 2 integers, the second of
	 which must be equal to the value contained in the switch case
	 determined by the first interger, which must be between 0 and 7.
Phase 4: Explodes unless the given string contains 1 integer x such that:
	 7 ^ x = 5764801
Phase 5: Explodes unless the given string contains 2 integers. The first integer
	 is the starting index in the array. This integer must be 13, so after
	 10 jumps, it will land on 15. The second integer is the sum of all
	 indices visited, not including the starting index. This integer must
	 be 69 because that is the sum of {9, 4, 8, 0, 10, 1, 2, 14, 6, 15}, the
	 indices visited.
Phase 6: Explodes unless the given string contains 1 integer. The integer must
	 be equal to the 5th value in the sorted linked list: 663.

We spent 15 hours on this assignment.
