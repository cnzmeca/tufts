1.
a.      Yes
b.      Yes
c.      Yes
d.      No change is needed
e.      Env' is the exact same as Env because the name type is still set to
        string by the structure ExposedEnv even though it is not assigned in
        the signature ENV

2.
a.
functor TestSetFun(
        name:string,
        compare:(test * test -> order),
        testToString:(test -> string)      
        )
        :> TEST_SET = struct ... end

b.      
structure CheckTypeSet :> TEST_SET where type test = check_type_test =
TestSetFun(
        fun uid          (u, _, _, _) = u
        fun serialNumber (_, k, _, _) = k
        fun exp          (_, _, e, _) = e
        fun ty           (_, _, _, t) = t
        val name = uid test
        fun compare (test1 test2) =
        case String.compare (uid test1, uid test2)
                of EQUAL => Int.compare (serialNumber test1, serialNumber test2)
                | diff  => diff
        fun testToString test = concat["(check-type ", expString (exp test),
                                       " " , tyString (ty test), ")"]
3.
a. "where type test = check_type_test" is instatiating the abstract type test
as the type check_type_test
b. The structure would not be able to use the type test because it is not given
a concrete definition

4. 
a.
fun invariant [] = true
|   invariant x::[] = true
|   invariant x::y::zs = (x < y) andalso invariant (y::zs)

b.
fun invariant ZERO = true
|   invariant TIMES10PLUS(ZERO, 0) = false
|   invariant TIMES10PLUS(m, d) = if (d < 10) then true else false

c.
fun absfun (l, f, r) =
List.concat[(List.map UNFINGERED l), [FINGERED f], (List.map UNFINGERED r)]

5. 
02 divided by 7 == 0 remainder 2
29 divided by 7 == 4 remainder 1
11 divided by 7 == 1 remainder 4
48 divided by 7 == 6 remainder 6

6.
a.
  q0 = 6          r0 = 1
  q1 = 3          r1 = 0
  q2 = 1          r2 = 1
  q3 = 0          r3 = 1

  1101

b.
  q0 = 3          r0 = 1
  q1 = 0          r1 = 3
