1.
a.      receiver:       w
        argument:       2
        message:        div
b.      receiver:       shape
        argument:       self
        message:        drawOn

c.      receiver:       shapes
        argument:       [block (shape) (drawOn: shape self)]
        message:        do

2.
a.      nothing
b.      # of :'s = # of args

3.
a.      add and draw are part of the instance protocol and empty is part of the
        class protocol
b.      messages in the class protocol are handled by class-methods while
        messages in the instance protocol are handled by methods
        class-methods are usually used to instanciate or delete objects
4.      
        Dispatch to method m1 on class C
        Dispatch to method m1 on class B
        Dispatch to method m2 on class B

6.
a.      1.      Method new on class ListSentinel
        2.      Method new on class SequenceableCollection
        3.      Method sentinel on class
b.      1.      Creates new sentinel instance
        2.      Creates new superclass instance
        3.      Sets the sentinel to the superclass instance
c.      1

7.      1.      Convert a Number instance to an Integer instance
        2       Convert a Number instance to an Fraction instance.
        3.      Convert a Number instance to an Float instance
        4.      Delegate the responsibility of converting the instance to a
                Number instance to the instances asNumber method

8.      b

9.      
a.      = and <
b.      +, *, negated, reciprocial, asInteger, asFraction, asFloat, coerce

10.
a.      +, *, coerce
b.      Method + sends addLargePositiveIntegerTo: to the argument
        Method * sends timesLargePositiveIntegerTo: to the argument
        Method coerce sends toLargePositiveIntegerTo: to the argument
