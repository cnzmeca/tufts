README - this file.

Compilation and Execution:
To compile this program type "make" into your command prompt.
To execute this program type "./CalcYouLater" into your command prompt.

Data Structures:
To implement the stack I used a sequence. I chose to use a sequence because it
is much easier to clear the stack and determine the size of the stack using a
sequence than it is to do so using a linked list. A stack is necessary for an
RPN calculator because the way the calculator works is by performing the
operation on the most recently added data. A stack excels at accessing the most
recently added data because of its FIFO nature. None of my algorithms were
particularly complex, but I did enjoy writing the exec command because I learned
about istringstream variables to complete it.

Testing:
To test the DatumStack class I unit tested each function and compared the actual
results to the results that would result from a correct implementation. I
tested all functions on both empty and nonempty stacks and checked both error
cases. To test the RPNCalc class I took a different approach. Since all of
the commands are dependent on cin and the only nonprivate function is run(), my
testRPNCalc.cpp was identical to my main.cpp. Although there is no way to show
it I unit tested all of the commands. I used the following in a file to test
the file command:
4 5 - 6 * print
