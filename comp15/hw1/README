HW 1

Assignment Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to create and test a character sequence class.

Help Received:
I did not receive any help with this assignment.

Files Provided:
CharSequence.cpp - the cpp file for the CharSequence class. Contains all member
functions and data.
CharSequence.h - the header file for the CharSequence class. Contains the class
definition.
testCharSequence.cpp - the test file for the CharSequence class. Contains unit
testing of each public member function and constructor.
README - this file.

Compilation and Execution:
To compile this program, enter:
'clang++ -Wall -Wextra testCharSequence.cpp CharSequence.cpp'
into your command prompt.
To run this program, enter './a.out' into your command prompt.

Data Structures:
In this assignment the data structure I used was a sequence, or dynamically
allocated array. Sequences are created using the new operator, so they exist
on the heap and must be deallocated before the end of the program to prevent
memory leakage.
	Pros: Sequences are very good at accessing and altering elements based
	on index. It is also very easy to append to the end of a sequence,
	provided it has sufficient capacity.
	Cons: Sequences have a predetermined capacity, and once that capacity
	is reached, the sequence must be copied over to another with greater
	capacity and then deleted. Not only is this tedious, but it often leads
	to overallocation of memory.

Testing:
As recommended, my approach to testing was unit testing. I began by creating
and testing my constructors, as without these, most member functions cannot be
tested. Next, I created and tested all of the easy member functions that would
not require private helper functions. Then I created and tested my private
helper functions. Since these are private, I couldn't test them directly, but
I was able to test them indirectly when I tested the remaining functions that
were dependent upon them.
