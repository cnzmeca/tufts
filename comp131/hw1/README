The genome of my individuals is a boolean array of length 7, each boolean gene representing whether
or not the corresponding box is in the knapsack.

The fitness is determined by the sum of the importances of the boxes, minus 1 for every 5 pounds
over the weight limit.

The fringe operations, mutation and crossover, are defined as adding/removing a box and swapping 2
boxes respectively.

Run command: python knapsack.py
