I have written 4 python files for this assignment, which have produced a variety
of data files that I have omitted from the submission because otherwise it woukd
excede the file size limit.  I can provide these files upon request.

The 4 files are:
parse.py
preprocess.py
classify.py
majority_vote.py

parse.py takes an input file name containing a review dataset, and otuputs a
version of the dataset that has only lowercase letters, spaces, and apostrophes.

preprocess.py takes 3 inputs: a training dataset, a test dataset, and an
embedding, in this case GloVe. It outputs 4 data files: train and test bag of
words and word embedding files.

classify.py takes 5 inputs: a training data file (either bag of words or word
embedding works), a testing data file (same deal), and hyperparameters for
KNN, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, in that order. After
running it with both bag of words and word embeddings, it will have produced
5 prediction files, as well as providing CV error estimations for each
classifier.

majority_vote.py takes a path to a directory containing the 5 prediction files
generated by classify.py. It returns a single prediction file that is the result
of an unweighted majority vote between all 5 prediction files.
