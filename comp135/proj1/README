To run my program logreg.py, use the command:
python logreg.py [filename] [scale] [grad] [lambda] [alpha] [term] [fold]

filename is the name of a csv file containing training data
scale is a bool deciding if the data should be scaled by the maximum element
grad is the gradient descent type
lambda is the regularizer value
alpha is the step size
term is the cutoff for diff
fold is the number of folds in cross validation
